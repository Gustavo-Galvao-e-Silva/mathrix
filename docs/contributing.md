# Contributing

panchi welcomes contributions that align with its educational mission. The full contribution guide lives in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Gustavo-Galvao-e-Silva/panchi/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) in the repository.

The short version: clarity first, tests required, docstrings in NumPy style, and mathematical accuracy over cleverness.
