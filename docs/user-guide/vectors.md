# Vectors

A vector is an ordered list of numbers. In panchi, `Vector` is the fundamental object representing a point or direction in n-dimensional space.

## Construction

```python
import panchi as pan

v = pan.Vector([1, 2, 3])
print(v)       # [1, 2, 3]
print(v.dims)  # 3
```

Vectors can only hold numbers (int or float). Passing anything else raises a `TypeError` with an explanation.

## Arithmetic

Vectors support standard arithmetic with natural syntax:

```python
a = pan.Vector([1, 2, 3])
b = pan.Vector([4, 5, 6])

print(a + b)   # [5, 7, 9]
print(a - b)   # [-3, -3, -3]
print(2 * a)   # [2, 4, 6]
print(a / 2)   # [0.5, 1.0, 1.5]
print(-a)      # [-1, -2, -3]
```

All operations return a new `Vector` and leave the original unchanged.

## Magnitude and normalization

The magnitude of a vector is its Euclidean length — the square root of the sum of squared components.

```python
v = pan.Vector([3, 4])
print(v.magnitude)   # 5.0
print(v.normalize()) # [0.6, 0.8]
```

`normalize()` returns the unit vector pointing in the same direction. It raises `ZeroDivisionError` if the vector has zero magnitude.

## Dot product

The dot product of two vectors measures how much they point in the same direction. It is defined as the sum of the products of corresponding components.

$$\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \sum_{i} u_i v_i$$

```python
u = pan.Vector([1, 2, 3])
v = pan.Vector([4, 5, 6])
print(pan.dot(u, v))  # 32
```

If the dot product is zero, the vectors are orthogonal.

## Cross product

The cross product is defined only for 3D vectors. It produces a new vector perpendicular to both inputs, with magnitude equal to the area of the parallelogram they span.

```python
u = pan.Vector([1, 0, 0])
v = pan.Vector([0, 1, 0])
print(pan.cross(u, v))  # [0, 0, 1]
```

## Factory functions

panchi provides several convenience functions for constructing common vectors:

```python
pan.zero_vector(3)      # [0, 0, 0]
pan.one_vector(3)       # [1, 1, 1]
pan.unit_vector(3, 1)   # [0, 1, 0]  — standard basis vector e₁
pan.random_vector(3)    # random entries
```

## Indexing and iteration

Vectors are indexable and iterable:

```python
v = pan.Vector([10, 20, 30])
print(v[0])            # 10
v[1] = 99              # mutation is supported
print(list(v))         # [10, 99, 30]
```

## Conversion

```python
v = pan.Vector([1, 2, 3])
v.to_list()    # [1, 2, 3]  — returns an independent copy
v.to_tuple()   # (1, 2, 3)
```
