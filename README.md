# panchi

**panchi** is a Python-native linear algebra library designed for learning, experimentation, and visual intuition.

The goal is not performance. The goal is **clarity**.

## Why panchi?

Most linear algebra libraries optimize for speed and abstraction. panchi optimizes for **understanding**.

panchi is built for students who want to see the math happen, educators who need transparent implementations, and anyone who has ever wondered what a matrix is *actually doing*.

Think of it as a **laboratory notebook**, not a production engine.

## Philosophy

1. **Explicit over implicit** – Algorithms are implemented directly, not delegated to opaque backends
2. **Readable over clever** – Code prioritizes clarity and educational value over terse optimizations
3. **Mathematical over computational** – Objects behave like mathematical entities with proper operator overloading
4. **Visual by default** – Visualization is a first-class feature, not an afterthought
5. **Informative errors** – Error messages guide learning by explaining what went wrong and why

## Installation

```bash
pip install panchi
```

Requires Python 3.10+. For optional Manim-powered visualizations:

```bash
pip install panchi[manim]
```

## A Taste

```python
import panchi as pan
from panchi.algorithms import rref, solve

# Vectors and matrices behave like their mathematical counterparts
A = pan.Matrix([[1, 2, 3], [2, 5, 7], [0, 1, 2]])
b = pan.Vector([1, 0, 0])

# Solve Ax = b — see the status, not just the answer
result = solve(A, b)
print(result.status)    # 'unique'
print(result.solution)  # the solution vector x

# Row reduction shows every step it takes
reduction = rref(A)
print(reduction)        # full step-by-step walkthrough
print(reduction.rank)   # 3
```
